# Imepdance-project
This is a project design for Logan Liu's Lab project.
Credit to Chengpeng Hu and Kenny Ren from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
The goal of the project is to use Mobile phone to sense the impedance in real-time in order to establish a sensing platform
to adopt different kind of sensor including temperature, light, thermal, moisture and etc.
